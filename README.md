# VueBnB
- This is a starter project for Jake And Zander, at the web development team at utilita. 
- We where given the task to develop a website with vite and vue
that will be very similar to a airbnb website.

### **Variable Naming**
> We decided that we would use camelCase when
naming all of our variables in javascript.
